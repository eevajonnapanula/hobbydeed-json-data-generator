# Hobbydeed JSON-data generator

This is a small GraphQL - project for generating JSON-data to import to Hobbydeed's event import-tool. Right now it supports only generating recurring events before given date.

And I know, for those, who have used Hobbydeed, there is some possibilities to maybe make this easier (more clicks in the interface, though), but I wanted to test if I could make this.

Demo running in: https://hobbydeed-json-generator.herokuapp.com/

## TODO:
- [ ] Add possibility to choose if event is recurring or not
- [ ] Add possibility to choose how many days apart an event is
